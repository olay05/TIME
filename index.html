                     so today is the one many companies allow their employees to bring their pups with them. Some workplaces
                      are so fantastic dogs are welcome all year round! While it’s obviously not recommended
                     for dogs to be broughtto work sites that are dangerous 
                    for them or where they’ll get in,  an operating room or a factory floor, 
                    offices can be the perfect environment for pets.</p>

                <p> Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical gifts to the world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef. Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls sushi can be found in every price range sushi can be found in every price range of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho Masa in Roppongi is nothing short of perfection. At around ¥20,000 ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap</p>

"Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung. </p>
